**Resolution:** Review the logs for additional context and investigate the root cause. Update exception handling to capture and classify this error more specifically if possible.

## Exception Type: READ_ERROR
**Description:** An error occurred while attempting to read data from a file or input source. This may be due to file corruption, missing files, or access issues.
**Resolution:** Verify the file exists, is accessible, and is not corrupted. Check permissions and retry the operation.

## Exception Type: JSONValidationException
**Description:** The JSON data does not conform to the expected schema or structure, resulting in a validation failure.
**Resolution:** Validate the JSON data against the expected schema and correct any discrepancies before reprocessing.

## Exception Type: ConstraintViolationException
**Description:** A data constraint (such as a unique key, not-null, or foreign key constraint) was violated during processing.
**Resolution:** Ensure all data meets the required constraints and correct any violations before retrying the operation.

## Exception Type: DuplicateKeyException
**Description:** An attempt was made to insert or update data with a key that already exists, violating uniqueness constraints.
**Resolution:** Remove or update duplicate entries to ensure all keys are unique before processing.

## Exception Type: ConcurrentModificationException
**Description:** A collection or resource was modified concurrently by multiple threads or processes, causing an inconsistency.
**Resolution:** Implement proper synchronization or use thread-safe data structures to prevent concurrent modifications.

## Exception Type: ServiceUnavailableException
**Description:** A required external service or dependency is temporarily unavailable or not responding.
**Resolution:** Check the status of the external service and retry the operation after the service becomes available.

## Exception Type: RuntimeException
**Description:** A general runtime exception occurred, indicating an unexpected problem during execution.
**Resolution:** Review the stack trace and logs to identify and address the underlying issue.

## Exception Type: NoSuchElementException
**Description:** An attempt was made to access an element that does not exist in a collection or data source.
**Resolution:** Ensure the element exists before attempting to access it, or handle the absence gracefully.

## Exception Type: IllegalArgumentException
**Description:** A method received an argument that is invalid or inappropriate for the operation.
**Resolution:** Validate input arguments before passing them to methods and ensure they meet the expected criteria.

## Exception Type: IOException
**Description:** An input/output operation failed or was interrupted, often due to file system or network issues.
**Resolution:** Check file paths, network connections, and resource availability. Retry the operation if appropriate.

## Exception Type: ElementNotInteractableException
**Description:** An attempt was made to interact with a UI element that is not currently interactable (e.g., hidden or disabled).
**Resolution:** Ensure the UI element is visible and enabled before interacting with it.

## Exception Type: TimeoutException

**Resolution:** Increase the timeout threshold if appropriate, or optimize the operation to complete within the allowed time.

**Resolution:** Check for null values before performing operations and ensure all objects are properly initialized.

## Exception Type: SocketTimeoutException
**Description:** A network socket operation timed out, possibly due to network latency or unresponsive endpoints.
**Resolution:** Check network connectivity and endpoint responsiveness. Increase the socket timeout if necessary.

## Exception Type: AuthenticationException
**Description:** Authentication failed due to invalid credentials or insufficient permissions.
**Resolution:** Verify credentials and permissions, and ensure authentication details are correct.

## Exception Type: DataIntegrityViolationException
**Description:** An operation violated data integrity rules, such as inserting invalid or inconsistent data.
**Resolution:** Validate data for integrity before processing and correct any inconsistencies.

## Exception Type: HttpResponseException
**Description:** An HTTP request returned an unexpected or error response code.
**Resolution:** Check the request parameters and endpoint. Handle error responses appropriately and retry if needed.

## Exception Type: PerformanceSLAException
**Description:** A performance service-level agreement (SLA) was breached, indicating the operation did not meet required performance criteria.
**Resolution:** Optimize the operation to meet performance SLAs or adjust SLA thresholds if justified.

## Exception Type: IllegalStateException
**Description:** A method was invoked at an inappropriate or illegal time, given the current state of the application.
**Resolution:** Ensure the application is in the correct state before invoking the method.

## Exception Type: ConnectException
**Description:** A connection attempt to a remote host or service failed.
**Resolution:** Verify the network connection and the availability of the remote host or service.

## Exception Type: AssertionError
**Description:** An assertion failed, indicating that an expected condition was not met during execution.
