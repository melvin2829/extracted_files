# Exception Insights

## UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION
**Exception Description:** An unidentified error occurred during processing. The system could not categorize this exception based on known patterns.
**Resolution:** Review the log details for this case manually to identify the root cause and update exception handling logic to cover this scenario.

## READ_ERROR
**Exception Description:** The system encountered an error while attempting to read the input file. This could be due to file corruption, missing file, or insufficient permissions.
**Resolution:** Verify the file exists, is accessible, and is not corrupted. Ensure the process has the necessary permissions to read the file.

## NullPointerException
**Exception Description:** A null value was accessed where an object reference was required. This typically occurs when the code attempts to use an object that has not been initialized.
**Resolution:** Check for missing or uninitialized objects in the workflow and ensure all required data is present before processing.

## IllegalArgumentException
**Exception Description:** An invalid argument was passed to a method or function. This often happens when input values do not meet the expected criteria.
**Resolution:** Validate all input parameters before invoking methods and ensure they conform to expected formats and ranges.

## SocketTimeoutException
**Exception Description:** A network socket operation timed out. This usually indicates network latency or connectivity issues between services.
**Resolution:** Check network connectivity and increase timeout settings if necessary. Ensure the target service is available and responsive.

## ConstraintViolationException
**Exception Description:** A database or system constraint was violated, such as a unique key or foreign key constraint.
**Resolution:** Review the data being inserted or updated for constraint violations and ensure all business rules are adhered to.

## ElementNotInteractableException
**Exception Description:** An attempt was made to interact with a UI element that is not currently interactable, possibly due to it being hidden or disabled.
**Resolution:** Ensure the UI element is visible and enabled before attempting interaction. Add checks or waits as necessary.

## ServiceUnavailableException
**Exception Description:** The requested service is currently unavailable, possibly due to downtime or maintenance.
**Resolution:** Verify the service status and retry the operation after some time. Implement fallback mechanisms if possible.

## PerformanceSLAException
**Exception Description:** A performance Service Level Agreement (SLA) was breached, indicating the process took longer than the allowed threshold.
**Resolution:** Optimize the workflow or system to improve performance. Review resource allocation and identify bottlenecks.

## DuplicateKeyException
**Exception Description:** A duplicate key was detected during a database operation, violating uniqueness constraints.
**Resolution:** Ensure all keys are unique before insertion. Implement checks to prevent duplicate entries.

## AuthenticationException
**Exception Description:** Authentication failed due to invalid credentials or missing authentication information.
**Resolution:** Verify credentials and authentication configuration. Ensure all required authentication data is provided.

## IOException
**Exception Description:** An input/output error occurred during file or network operations. This could be due to file system issues or network interruptions.
**Resolution:** Check file paths, permissions, and network connectivity. Retry the operation or handle the error gracefully.

## IllegalStateException
**Exception Description:** The application is in an inappropriate state for the requested operation, often due to incorrect workflow sequencing.
**Resolution:** Review workflow logic to ensure operations are performed in the correct order and all prerequisites are met.

## ConcurrentModificationException
**Exception Description:** A collection was modified concurrently while being iterated, leading to inconsistent state.
**Resolution:** Avoid modifying collections during iteration. Use thread-safe structures or synchronize access as needed.

## RuntimeException
**Exception Description:** A generic runtime error occurred, indicating an unexpected failure during execution.
**Resolution:** Review the stack trace and logs for more details. Implement error handling and validation to prevent such failures.

## DataIntegrityViolationException
**Exception Description:** Data integrity rules were violated, such as mismatched or missing required fields.
**Resolution:** Validate data before processing and ensure all integrity constraints are satisfied.

## NoSuchElementException
**Exception Description:** An attempt was made to access an element that does not exist, such as fetching from an empty collection.
**Resolution:** Check for the existence of elements before accessing them. Implement checks to avoid out-of-bounds access.

## ConnectException
**Exception Description:** Failed to establish a network connection to the target host or service.
**Resolution:** Verify network configuration and target service availability. Retry the connection or escalate if persistent.

## TimeoutException
**Exception Description:** An operation exceeded the allowed time limit and was aborted.
**Resolution:** Increase timeout settings if appropriate and optimize the operation to complete within the expected timeframe.

## HttpResponseException
**Exception Description:** An HTTP response error occurred, such as receiving a non-success status code from a web service.
**Resolution:** Check the request parameters and target endpoint. Handle HTTP errors gracefully and implement retries if needed.

## AssertionError
**Exception Description:** An assertion failed, indicating that a condition expected to be true was false during testing or validation.
**Resolution:** Review the assertion logic and ensure test conditions are correctly defined. Fix the underlying issue causing the failure.

## JSONValidationException
**Exception Description:** JSON data failed validation against the expected schema, possibly due to missing or incorrectly formatted fields.
**Resolution:** Validate JSON data before processing and ensure it conforms to the required schema.
