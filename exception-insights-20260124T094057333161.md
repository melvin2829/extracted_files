# Exception Insights

## UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION
**Exception Description:** An unknown exception occurred. This typically means the error could not be classified into any known category, possibly due to insufficient or unrecognized error information.
**Resolution:** Review the logs for additional details. If possible, enhance error handling to capture more specific exception details.

## READ_ERROR
**Exception Description:** A read error occurred while attempting to access or process a file. This may be due to file corruption, missing files, or permission issues.
**Resolution:** Verify that the file exists, is not corrupted, and that the process has the necessary permissions to read it.

## NullPointerException
**Exception Description:** A NullPointerException occurs when the application attempts to use an object reference that has not been initialized (i.e., it is null).
**Resolution:** Ensure all objects are properly initialized before use and add null checks where appropriate.

## IllegalArgumentException
**Exception Description:** An IllegalArgumentException is thrown when a method receives an argument that is inappropriate or outside the expected range.
**Resolution:** Validate all input parameters before passing them to methods to ensure they meet the required criteria.

## SocketTimeoutException
**Exception Description:** A SocketTimeoutException indicates that a network socket timed out while waiting for a response from a remote host.
**Resolution:** Check network connectivity and server responsiveness. Consider increasing the timeout value if necessary.

## ConstraintViolationException
**Exception Description:** A ConstraintViolationException occurs when a database operation violates a defined constraint, such as a unique key or foreign key constraint.
**Resolution:** Ensure that all data modifications comply with database constraints. Review and correct the data causing the violation.

## ElementNotInteractableException
**Exception Description:** An ElementNotInteractableException is thrown when an attempt is made to interact with a web element that is not currently interactable (e.g., hidden or disabled).
**Resolution:** Ensure the element is visible and enabled before attempting to interact with it. Add appropriate waits if necessary.

## ServiceUnavailableException
**Exception Description:** A ServiceUnavailableException indicates that a requested service is temporarily unavailable, possibly due to server overload or maintenance.
**Resolution:** Retry the operation after a delay. Check the service status and ensure it is running and accessible.

## PerformanceSLAException
**Exception Description:** A PerformanceSLAException occurs when a process or operation exceeds the defined Service Level Agreement (SLA) for performance.
**Resolution:** Optimize the operation to meet performance requirements. Review system resources and workload.

## DuplicateKeyException
**Exception Description:** A DuplicateKeyException is thrown when an attempt is made to insert a duplicate key value into a database table with a unique constraint.
**Resolution:** Ensure that all key values are unique before insertion. Check for existing records with the same key.

## AuthenticationException
**Exception Description:** An AuthenticationException occurs when authentication fails, typically due to invalid credentials or expired tokens.
**Resolution:** Verify the credentials or authentication tokens being used. Ensure they are correct and have not expired.

## IOException
**Exception Description:** An IOException indicates an input/output operation failure, such as reading from or writing to a file or network resource.
**Resolution:** Check file paths, permissions, and network connectivity. Handle IO operations with appropriate error handling.

## IllegalStateException
**Exception Description:** An IllegalStateException is thrown when a method is invoked at an illegal or inappropriate time, or the object is not in the correct state.
**Resolution:** Ensure that the object's state is valid before invoking methods. Add state checks where necessary.

## ConcurrentModificationException
**Exception Description:** A ConcurrentModificationException occurs when an object is modified concurrently while it is being iterated, typically in a multi-threaded environment.
**Resolution:** Avoid modifying collections while iterating over them. Use thread-safe collections or synchronization as needed.

## RuntimeException
**Exception Description:** A RuntimeException is a general exception that indicates an unexpected problem occurred during program execution.
**Resolution:** Review the stack trace and logs to identify the root cause. Add appropriate error handling and validation.

## DataIntegrityViolationException
**Exception Description:** A DataIntegrityViolationException is thrown when a data integrity constraint is violated in the database, such as a foreign key or unique constraint.
**Resolution:** Validate data before database operations to ensure integrity constraints are not violated.

## NoSuchElementException
**Exception Description:** A NoSuchElementException occurs when an attempt is made to access an element that does not exist, such as retrieving from an empty collection.
**Resolution:** Check for the existence of elements before accessing them. Use appropriate checks or exception handling.

## ConnectException
**Exception Description:** A ConnectException indicates a failure to connect to a remote host or service, often due to network issues or incorrect address.
**Resolution:** Verify the network connection and the address of the remote host. Ensure the service is running and reachable.

## TimeoutException
**Exception Description:** A TimeoutException is thrown when a blocking operation times out before completion, such as waiting for a resource or response.
**Resolution:** Increase the timeout value if appropriate. Investigate and resolve the cause of the delay.

## HttpResponseException
**Exception Description:** An HttpResponseException occurs when an HTTP request receives an error response from the server, such as 4xx or 5xx status codes.
**Resolution:** Check the request parameters and server status. Handle HTTP error responses appropriately.

## AssertionError
**Exception Description:** An AssertionError is thrown when an assertion fails, indicating that a program assumption was not met.
**Resolution:** Review the assertion and ensure the program logic meets the expected conditions.

## JSONValidationException
**Exception Description:** A JSONValidationException occurs when JSON data fails to meet the required schema or structure.
**Resolution:** Validate JSON data against the expected schema before processing. Correct any schema mismatches.
