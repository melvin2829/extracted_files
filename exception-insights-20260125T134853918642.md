# Exception Insights

## UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION
**Description:** An unidentified error occurred during processing. The system was unable to categorize the exception based on known patterns.
**Resolution:** Review the log file for additional details and escalate to the development team for further investigation.

## READ_ERROR
**Description:** The system encountered an error while attempting to read the log file. This may be due to file corruption, missing permissions, or unsupported file format.
**Resolution:** Verify the integrity of the log file, check file permissions, and ensure the file format is supported before reprocessing.

## ElementNotInteractableException
**Description:** A UI element was found but could not be interacted with (e.g., not clickable, not visible, or disabled) during automation.
**Resolution:** Ensure the element is visible, enabled, and ready for interaction before performing actions. Add appropriate waits or checks in the automation script.

## PerformanceSLAException
**Description:** The operation did not meet the defined Service Level Agreement (SLA) for performance, such as exceeding response time thresholds.
**Resolution:** Optimize the process or system to improve performance. Review resource allocation and investigate bottlenecks.

## DuplicateKeyException
**Description:** An attempt was made to insert a duplicate key into a data structure or database, violating uniqueness constraints.
**Resolution:** Ensure that all keys are unique before insertion. Implement checks to prevent duplicate entries.

## ConcurrentModificationException
**Description:** A collection was modified concurrently while being iterated, leading to inconsistent state or runtime errors.
**Resolution:** Avoid modifying collections while iterating over them. Use thread-safe collections or synchronize access as needed.

## ConnectException
**Description:** Failed to establish a network connection to the target host or service, possibly due to network issues or incorrect endpoint.
**Resolution:** Verify network connectivity, endpoint URL, and service availability. Retry the connection if appropriate.

## IllegalArgumentException
**Description:** An invalid or inappropriate argument was passed to a method or function, violating expected input constraints.
**Resolution:** Validate all input parameters before invoking methods. Ensure arguments meet the required criteria.

## IOException
**Description:** An input/output operation failed, such as reading from or writing to a file or network stream.
**Resolution:** Check file paths, permissions, and network connectivity. Handle exceptions gracefully and retry if possible.

## NoSuchElementException
**Description:** An attempt was made to access an element that does not exist in a collection or UI context.
**Resolution:** Ensure the element exists before accessing it. Add checks or exception handling to manage missing elements.

## ServiceUnavailableException
**Description:** The requested service is temporarily unavailable, possibly due to maintenance, overload, or downtime.
**Resolution:** Retry the request after some time. Monitor service health and notify support if the issue persists.

## HttpResponseException
**Description:** An unexpected HTTP response was received, such as a non-2xx status code indicating failure.
**Resolution:** Check the request parameters and endpoint. Handle error responses appropriately and implement retries or fallbacks.

## JSONValidationException
**Description:** The JSON data failed validation against the expected schema or structure.
**Resolution:** Validate JSON data before processing. Ensure the data conforms to the required schema and correct any discrepancies.

## ConstraintViolationException
**Description:** A data operation violated defined constraints, such as uniqueness, foreign key, or validation rules.
**Resolution:** Review and correct the data to comply with all constraints before performing the operation.

## NullPointerException
**Description:** An operation attempted to use a null reference, leading to a runtime error.
**Resolution:** Check for null values before accessing objects or properties. Implement null checks and default values where appropriate.

## RuntimeException
**Description:** A generic runtime error occurred that does not fit into more specific exception categories.
**Resolution:** Review the stack trace and error message for details. Implement appropriate error handling and logging.

## TimeoutException
**Description:** An operation exceeded the allowed time limit and was aborted.
**Resolution:** Increase the timeout value if appropriate, optimize the operation, or investigate potential delays.

## IllegalStateException
**Description:** A method was invoked at an inappropriate time or the object is in an invalid state for the operation.
**Resolution:** Ensure the object is in the correct state before invoking methods. Add state checks and transitions as needed.

## AuthenticationException
**Description:** Authentication failed due to invalid credentials or missing authentication information.
**Resolution:** Verify credentials and authentication configuration. Ensure all required authentication steps are completed.

## DataIntegrityViolationException
**Description:** A data operation violated integrity constraints, such as referential integrity or data consistency rules.
**Resolution:** Review and correct the data to ensure integrity constraints are met before performing the operation.

## SocketTimeoutException
**Description:** A network socket operation timed out due to slow response or connectivity issues.
**Resolution:** Increase the socket timeout value if appropriate. Check network stability and server responsiveness.

## AssertionError
**Description:** An assertion failed during test execution, indicating that an expected condition was not met.
**Resolution:** Review the test case and expected conditions. Update the test or application logic to ensure assertions are valid.
