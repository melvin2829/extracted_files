# Exception Insights

## UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION
**Exception Description:** An unknown exception occurred which could not be classified into any predefined category. This typically indicates an unexpected or unhandled error in the system.
**Resolution:** Review the log details for more information. Enhance exception handling to capture and categorize unknown errors.

## READ_ERROR
**Exception Description:** A read error occurred while attempting to access or process the log file. This may be due to file corruption, missing files, or permission issues.
**Resolution:** Verify the existence and integrity of the log file. Ensure the process has the necessary permissions to read the file.

## DuplicateKeyException
**Exception Description:** A duplicate key was encountered where a unique value was expected. This often occurs when inserting or updating records with a key that already exists in the database.
**Resolution:** Ensure that all keys are unique before performing insert or update operations. Check for existing records with the same key.

## ConnectException
**Exception Description:** A connection attempt to a remote service or database failed. This may be due to network issues, incorrect configuration, or the target service being unavailable.
**Resolution:** Check network connectivity and configuration settings. Ensure the target service is running and accessible.

## DataIntegrityViolationException
**Exception Description:** A data integrity constraint was violated, such as a foreign key, unique, or not-null constraint in the database.
**Resolution:** Validate input data to ensure it meets all database constraints before performing operations.

## NoSuchElementException
**Exception Description:** An attempt was made to access an element that does not exist, such as retrieving an item from an empty collection.
**Resolution:** Check that the collection or resource contains the expected elements before accessing them.

## ConstraintViolationException
**Exception Description:** A validation constraint was violated, such as field length, format, or required value constraints.
**Resolution:** Ensure all input data meets the defined validation constraints before processing.

## AssertionError
**Exception Description:** An assertion failed during execution, indicating that an expected condition was not met.
**Resolution:** Review the assertion logic and ensure that preconditions and postconditions are correctly defined and met.

## RuntimeException
**Exception Description:** A general runtime exception occurred, indicating an unexpected error during program execution.
**Resolution:** Review the stack trace and logs to identify the root cause. Implement specific exception handling where possible.

## NullPointerException
**Exception Description:** An operation was attempted on a null object reference, leading to a null pointer exception.
**Resolution:** Check for null values before accessing object members or methods. Add null checks where necessary.

## AuthenticationException
**Exception Description:** An authentication failure occurred, such as invalid credentials or unauthorized access.
**Resolution:** Verify user credentials and authentication configuration. Ensure users have the correct permissions.

## TimeoutException
**Exception Description:** An operation exceeded the allowed time limit and was terminated due to a timeout.
**Resolution:** Optimize the operation to complete within the expected time. Increase timeout settings if necessary.

## JSONValidationException
**Exception Description:** JSON data failed validation, possibly due to missing required fields or incorrect data types.
**Resolution:** Validate JSON data against the expected schema before processing. Correct any schema mismatches.

## PerformanceSLAException
**Exception Description:** A performance Service Level Agreement (SLA) was violated, indicating that the operation did not meet required performance criteria.
**Resolution:** Optimize the operation for better performance. Review and adjust SLA thresholds if appropriate.

## ConcurrentModificationException
**Exception Description:** A collection was modified concurrently while being iterated, leading to inconsistent state.
**Resolution:** Avoid modifying collections while iterating over them. Use thread-safe collections or synchronization mechanisms.

## IOException
**Exception Description:** An input/output error occurred during file or network operations.
**Resolution:** Check file paths, permissions, and network connectivity. Handle IO exceptions gracefully in the code.

## ElementNotInteractableException
**Exception Description:** An attempt was made to interact with a UI element that is not currently interactable (e.g., hidden, disabled).
**Resolution:** Ensure the element is visible and enabled before interacting with it. Add appropriate waits if necessary.

## SocketTimeoutException
**Exception Description:** A socket operation timed out, typically due to network latency or unresponsive remote host.
**Resolution:** Check network stability and remote host availability. Increase socket timeout settings if needed.

## IllegalStateException
**Exception Description:** A method was invoked at an illegal or inappropriate time, indicating the object is not in the correct state for the operation.
**Resolution:** Ensure that the object's state is valid before invoking the method. Add state checks as necessary.

## ServiceUnavailableException
**Exception Description:** A requested service is temporarily unavailable, possibly due to maintenance or overload.
**Resolution:** Retry the operation after some time. Monitor the service status and ensure high availability.

## IllegalArgumentException
**Exception Description:** An illegal or inappropriate argument was passed to a method.
**Resolution:** Validate all arguments before passing them to methods. Ensure input values are within expected ranges.

## HttpResponseException
**Exception Description:** An HTTP response error occurred, such as a 4xx or 5xx status code returned from a web service.
**Resolution:** Check the request and response details. Handle HTTP errors appropriately and retry or escalate as needed.
