# Exception Insights

## UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION
**Description:** An unspecified or unrecognized error occurred during processing. This may be due to an unexpected condition or a lack of error handling for a specific scenario.
**Resolution:** Review the logs and application code to identify the root cause. Implement specific error handling for unknown exceptions.

## READ_ERROR
**Description:** The system encountered an error while attempting to read a file or resource. This could be due to file corruption, missing files, or permission issues.
**Resolution:** Verify the existence and integrity of the file. Ensure the application has the necessary permissions to access the resource.

## NullPointerException
**Description:** An operation was attempted on a null object reference. This typically occurs when an object is not properly initialized before use.
**Resolution:** Check for null values before performing operations. Ensure all objects are properly initialized.

## IllegalArgumentException
**Description:** A method received an argument that is inappropriate or outside the expected range. This may be due to invalid user input or incorrect program logic.
**Resolution:** Validate all input parameters before passing them to methods. Add checks to ensure arguments meet expected criteria.

## SocketTimeoutException
**Description:** A network socket operation timed out, likely due to slow network response or connectivity issues.
**Resolution:** Increase the socket timeout value if appropriate. Investigate network connectivity and server responsiveness.

## ConstraintViolationException
**Description:** A database or data integrity constraint was violated, such as a unique key or foreign key constraint.
**Resolution:** Ensure data being inserted or updated complies with all database constraints. Validate data before database operations.

## ElementNotInteractableException
**Description:** An attempt was made to interact with a UI element that is not currently interactable, possibly due to it being hidden or disabled.
**Resolution:** Check the state of UI elements before interacting. Ensure elements are visible and enabled at the time of interaction.

## ServiceUnavailableException
**Description:** A requested service is temporarily unavailable, possibly due to server downtime or maintenance.
**Resolution:** Retry the request after some time. Monitor service health and ensure high availability.

## PerformanceSLAException
**Description:** A performance Service Level Agreement (SLA) was not met, indicating that the operation took longer than the allowed threshold.
**Resolution:** Optimize code and system resources to improve performance. Review SLA requirements and adjust thresholds if necessary.

## DuplicateKeyException
**Description:** An attempt was made to insert a duplicate key into a database or data structure that requires unique keys.
**Resolution:** Ensure all keys are unique before insertion. Implement checks to prevent duplicate entries.

## AuthenticationException
**Description:** Authentication failed due to invalid credentials or missing authentication information.
**Resolution:** Verify user credentials and authentication configuration. Ensure proper authentication mechanisms are in place.

## IOException
**Description:** An input/output operation failed, possibly due to file system errors, network issues, or resource unavailability.
**Resolution:** Check file paths, network connections, and resource availability. Implement robust error handling for I/O operations.

## IllegalStateException
**Description:** A method was called at an inappropriate time or the application is in an invalid state for the requested operation.
**Resolution:** Review application state transitions and ensure methods are called only when the system is in a valid state.

## ConcurrentModificationException
**Description:** A collection was modified concurrently while being iterated, leading to inconsistent state.
**Resolution:** Avoid modifying collections while iterating over them. Use thread-safe collections or synchronization mechanisms.

## RuntimeException
**Description:** A generic runtime exception occurred, indicating an unexpected error during program execution.
**Resolution:** Review the stack trace and application logic to identify the cause. Implement specific exception handling where possible.

## DataIntegrityViolationException
**Description:** A data integrity violation occurred, such as attempting to insert invalid or inconsistent data into a database.
**Resolution:** Validate data before database operations. Ensure all data meets integrity constraints.

## NoSuchElementException
**Description:** An attempt was made to access an element that does not exist, such as retrieving from an empty collection.
**Resolution:** Check for element existence before accessing. Handle cases where collections may be empty.

## ConnectException
**Description:** A connection attempt failed, possibly due to network issues or the target server being unreachable.
**Resolution:** Verify network connectivity and server availability. Retry connection attempts if appropriate.

## TimeoutException
**Description:** An operation exceeded the allowed time limit and was aborted.
**Resolution:** Increase timeout limits if necessary. Optimize operations to complete within the expected time frame.

## HttpResponseException
**Description:** An HTTP request received an error response, such as 4xx or 5xx status codes.
**Resolution:** Check the request parameters and endpoint. Handle HTTP error responses appropriately.

## AssertionError
**Description:** An assertion failed, indicating that a condition expected to be true was false during testing or execution.
**Resolution:** Review assertions in code and tests. Ensure conditions being asserted are correct and achievable.

## JSONValidationException
**Description:** JSON data failed validation, possibly due to missing required fields or incorrect data types.
**Resolution:** Validate JSON data against the expected schema before processing. Correct any validation errors in the data.
