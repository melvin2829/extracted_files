# Exception Insights

## UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION
**Description:** An unspecified or unrecognized error occurred during processing. This may indicate an unexpected failure or a gap in error handling.
**Resolution:** Review the logs for additional details and update error handling to capture and categorize unknown exceptions more effectively.

## READ_ERROR
**Description:** The system encountered an error while attempting to read a file. This may be due to file corruption, missing files, or access permission issues.
**Resolution:** Verify the file's existence, integrity, and access permissions. Reprocess the file after resolving any issues.

## ConnectException
**Description:** A connection to a required service or resource could not be established. This typically occurs due to network issues, incorrect endpoints, or service downtime.
**Resolution:** Check network connectivity, validate endpoint URLs, and ensure the target service is running and accessible.

## AssertionError
**Description:** A test assertion failed, indicating that the actual result did not match the expected outcome. This is often due to logic errors or incorrect test data.
**Resolution:** Review the test case and expected results. Correct any discrepancies in the logic or test data.

## PerformanceSLAException
**Description:** A performance metric did not meet the defined Service Level Agreement (SLA). This may be due to slow response times or resource bottlenecks.
**Resolution:** Analyze performance logs to identify bottlenecks. Optimize code, infrastructure, or configurations to meet SLA requirements.

## HttpResponseException
**Description:** An unexpected HTTP response was received, such as a non-200 status code. This may indicate server errors, invalid requests, or authentication failures.
**Resolution:** Check the request parameters, authentication credentials, and server status. Correct any issues and retry the request.

## ElementNotInteractableException
**Description:** An attempt was made to interact with a UI element that is not currently interactable (e.g., hidden, disabled, or not yet loaded).
**Resolution:** Ensure the UI element is visible, enabled, and fully loaded before interacting with it. Add appropriate waits or checks in the automation script.

## IllegalArgumentException
**Description:** An invalid or inappropriate argument was passed to a method or function. This typically occurs due to incorrect input values.
**Resolution:** Validate all input arguments before invoking methods. Update the code to handle invalid arguments gracefully.

## RuntimeException
**Description:** A generic runtime error occurred during execution. This may be due to unhandled exceptions, logic errors, or resource issues.
**Resolution:** Review the stack trace and logs to identify the root cause. Implement proper exception handling and resolve any logic or resource issues.

## NoSuchElementException
**Description:** An attempt was made to access an element that does not exist in the current context (e.g., missing UI element or data entry).
**Resolution:** Verify the existence of the element before accessing it. Update selectors or queries to match the expected context.

## IOException
**Description:** An input/output error occurred during file or network operations. This may be due to file system issues, network interruptions, or resource unavailability.
**Resolution:** Check file paths, network connections, and resource availability. Retry the operation after resolving any issues.

## ServiceUnavailableException
**Description:** A required service is temporarily unavailable, possibly due to maintenance, overload, or network issues.
**Resolution:** Wait and retry the operation. If the issue persists, contact the service provider or check service status.

## DuplicateKeyException
**Description:** A duplicate key was detected during an operation that requires unique keys (e.g., database insert).
**Resolution:** Ensure all keys are unique before processing. Remove or update duplicate entries.

## IllegalStateException
**Description:** An operation was attempted in an inappropriate or illegal state, such as accessing resources before initialization.
**Resolution:** Check the application state before performing operations. Ensure proper initialization and state management.

## ConcurrentModificationException
**Description:** A collection was modified concurrently while being iterated, leading to inconsistent state.
**Resolution:** Avoid modifying collections during iteration. Use thread-safe collections or synchronization mechanisms.

## NullPointerException
**Description:** An attempt was made to access or modify an object reference that is null.
**Resolution:** Check for null references before accessing objects. Implement null checks and proper initialization.

## AuthenticationException
**Description:** Authentication failed due to invalid credentials or missing authentication tokens.
**Resolution:** Verify credentials and authentication tokens. Update them as needed and retry the operation.

## JSONValidationException
**Description:** JSON data failed validation against the expected schema or format.
**Resolution:** Validate JSON data before processing. Correct any schema or format errors.

## ConstraintViolationException
**Description:** A data constraint was violated, such as unique, foreign key, or not-null constraints in a database.
**Resolution:** Review and correct the data to comply with all constraints before processing.

## DataIntegrityViolationException
**Description:** An operation violated data integrity rules, such as inconsistent or invalid data relationships.
**Resolution:** Ensure data consistency and integrity before performing operations. Validate relationships and constraints.

## SocketTimeoutException
**Description:** A network socket operation timed out, possibly due to slow network or unresponsive endpoints.
**Resolution:** Check network connectivity and endpoint responsiveness. Increase timeout settings if necessary.

## TimeoutException
**Description:** An operation exceeded the allowed time limit and was aborted.
**Resolution:** Optimize the operation to complete within the allowed time. Increase timeout limits if appropriate.
